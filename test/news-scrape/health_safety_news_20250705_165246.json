    "https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/health-and-safety/firm-fined-after-apprentice-severed-thumb-in-hotel-build-04-07-2025/": "A construction firm has been fined £40,000 after an apprentice joiner had his thumb severed off by a rotating blade. The teenage apprentice was working for 3B Construction when the incident happened during the conversion of a 19th century hunting lodge into a luxury hotel in the Highlands. At the time of the incident on 8 June 2021, the apprentice, who had been with the company for six months, was using a portable table saw to cut plasterboard during the project at Hope Lodge in Tongue. His hand came into contact with the saw blade when he went to flick away material on it and the blade cut through his thumb. He was taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and underwent surgery where doctors managed to reattach his thumb. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said he still has long term complications as a result of the incident. \"He believes his thumb is working to around 70 per cent of what it used to be, and it has healed as much as it can,\" they said. \"It is shorter than his other thumb, he can’t bend it fully and it is permanently swollen. In winter he suffers significant discomfort when the thumb becomes stiff and sore.\" However, the man has since resumed his apprenticeship with another firm. The HSE said the 3B Construction was been fined £40,000 at Tain Sheriff Court. During its investigation the health and safety watchdog found that 3B Construction failed to: undertake a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks to employees operating a table circular saw, ensure that the system of work for the operation of said saw was safe and appropriately supervised, provided the apprentice joiners with the information, instruction and training needed to operate said saw safely. The HSE said 3B Construction Limited, of Cassillis Business Park, Minishant Ayr, pleaded guilty to Section 2(1) and Section 33(1)(a) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. HSE inspector Norman Schouten said: “While this young man continues to live with the trauma and impact of this incident, it’s greatly encouraging to see him continuing to work as a joiner. “However, it is only the efforts of medical professionals that prevented this from becoming a permanent amputation following the failures of the company. “Companies and individuals should be aware that HSE will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against those that fall below the required standards.” 2025-07-04 Nicola Harley Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Add to Bookmarks",

Osprey Foods Ltd said it was \"deeply regretful\" of the incident at its site in Holt, Norfolk, on 5 July 2023, and had introduced new safety measures. A worker was using a pallet truck to load an HGV when the driver pulled away, causing the man and truck to fall between the loading dock and rear of the HGV, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said. At Peterborough Magistrates' Court on 20 June, the company was fined £66,000, ordered to pay £5,850 in costs and a £2,000 victim surcharge. A company spokesperson said: \"Osprey Foods is deeply regretful of the incident that occurred in July 2023 and our sympathies and thoughts remain with our valued colleague.\" The accident left the man with injuries so severe his leg had to be amputated, the HSE said. The HSE's investigation found a traffic light system used to tell HGV drivers when it was safe to move their vehicles had been broken several weeks prior to the incident and had not been repaired. The investigation found the broken system had remained green during the loading process meaning the driver pulled away, unaware the employee was still in the trailer of the vehicle. 'Improved safety' Osprey Foods pleaded guilty to breaching sections 2(1) and 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. The company spokesperson said \"After a company evaluation into the incident, Osprey Foods has improved the safety of the site and measures include implementing new safeguarding systems, carrying out more extensive staff training and reinforcing operational procedures. \"The safety of Osprey Foods' dedicated staff is at the forefront of the health and safety policies and remains a paramount priority. \"Everyone at Osprey Foods is looking forward to welcoming our colleague back to the business in the near future.\" Follow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds , Facebook , Instagram and X .

The 56-year-old victim, named as Mohammed Hamad by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), suffered a broken leg, three fractures to his spine, five broken ribs and a broken pelvis and spent four months in hospital. The HSE prosecuted the garage, Car Spa & Tyres Ltd in Liverpool, after the accident on 23 November 2022. The firm, based in Marvin Street, Kensington, was fined £40,000 and ordered to pay £20,000 in costs at Liverpool Crown Court on Tuesday after being convicted of breaching health and safety rules by a jury. HSE HSE inspectors said it was \"fortunate nobody was killed\" The HSE said Mr Hamad, from Toxteth in Liverpool, was working on a car raised up on a two-post lift when he took a break to pray. An investigation concluded that two swivel arms on one of the columns were not locked into position, and the vehicle fell onto Mr Hamad. Inspectors found the garage had failed to put in place a safe system of work, or to sufficiently train their staff in the safe operation of lifting equipment. More than two years on, Mr Hamad is still \"highly dependent\" on his wife, is unable to carry out simple daily tasks and is unlikely to be ever able to work again, the HSE said. HSE inspector David Bellis said: \"This was a very serious incident, and it is fortunate nobody was killed as a result. \"If Mr Hamad had been suitably trained in the use of the two-post lift, the company had a suitable system of work in place and the swivel arms had been positioned correctly and locked into place this incident would have been avoided.\" Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook , X , and Instagram .

Oxford City Council was served an improvement notice after the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspected the building in February, which has since been resolved. It stated that the local authority had \"failed to ensure that where asbestos is or is liable to be present in buildings with public occupation\". The council said it had \"taken action to comply with the improvement notice\" and submitted the required evidence ahead of the deadline on 30 May. It comes as part of an HSE campaign to inspect hundreds of council buildings to check that they are managing the risk of asbestos properly, which was launched last December. The notice to Oxford City Council further stated that its staff had not prepared written plans for identifying the affected parts of the building and that measures to manage the risk of asbestos had not been set out in the written plans. The council said it had taken \"further steps to revisit any previously inaccessible areas and ensure management plans were in place for priority buildings\". \"The council has been working with the HSE continuously since the initial visit to ensure that all areas identified are compliant,\" a council spokesperson said. \"These have since been addressed within the timeframe and significant additional improvements have been made to strengthen how asbestos risks are managed and communicated across our estate.\" The statement added that there was \"no specific incident\" that led to the investigation. The council follows the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012, which requires asbestos-containing materials to be inspected regularly, usually once a year, or more often if needed. It has carried out asbestos management surveys for the town hall, with site plans and photos clearly showing the locations of any asbestos material and registers showing the known or presumed location of any asbestos-containing materials. The spokesperson added the information was \"reviewed regularly\" and that it had been made available to maintenance staff, contractors and anyone else who might need it.

A worker on the Station Hill development in Reading was rescued by crane operator Glen Edwards when it caught fire in November 2023 . The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said \"hot work\" – jobs which require open fires, flames or the application of heat – should be \"designed out wherever possible\". The building is set to open to tenants, including PepsiCo, on Saturday. The fire broke out shortly before midday on 23 November 2023, with plumes of thick black smoke visible for miles across Reading. PA Media The fire broke out at the development in Reading in November 2023 Mr Edwards, who was dubbed the \"Bruce Willis of Reading\", won a BBC Radio Berkshire Make a Difference award for his quick thinking. Two people were treated for smoke inhalation after the incident. The former NCP car park in Garrard Street was demolished to make way for the block, which was first given planning approval by Reading Borough Council in January 2021. The Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service has been asked to provide the cause of the blaze. \"To prevent future occurrences and develop best practice, the construction industry has shared lessons learned from this incident,\" the HSE's spokesperson said. \"This includes raising awareness that hot works should be designed out wherever possible, in order to eliminate fire risk. \"Those working on construction sites should ensure there are suitable and sufficient measures to manage the risk from fire.\" You can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook , X (Twitter) , or Instagram .

The Stage flagship mixed-use development in Luton is due to be built on the site of the former Bute Street railway station - which was replaced by a bus station and later demolished in 2008. The Building Safety Regulator (BSR) said there had been several applications \"one of which was rejected as it failed to demonstrate that the buildings, if constructed as designed, would meet legal requirements\". Luton Borough Council said it was committed to ensuring \"our application for the Stage development fully meets the required standards\". Luton Borough Council Bute Street car park, which closed in May last year, is the site of the new development A spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive, the umbrella organisation for BSR, said: \"The building control processes introduced following the Grenfell Tower tragedy are a vital safeguard, aimed at raising fire and structural safety standards across the built environment.\" They added that detailed plans submitted by the applicant for the Stage development around fire and emergency safety matters were not adequate or clear and there were a number of concerns over structural issues. A spokesperson for Luton Borough Council said: \"We have consistently provided comprehensive information to support our application, responded promptly to any requests for clarification, and made adjustments where required.\" The development, which is underpinned by £20m of levelling up funding , includes flats, a multi-purpose performance and community area, a food court and commercial space, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service . Luton Borough Council Two residential blocks of nine and 10 storeys are included in the plans Luton Borough Council's director of property and infrastructure Roger Kirk told the scrutiny finance review group on Tuesday that the delay in approving the project was costing the authority £100,000 a month.

    "https://www.hse-network.com/adapting-safety-systems-for-neurodiverse-workforces-rospa/": "25th Jun, 2025 Read time 2 minutes Adapting Safety Systems for Neurodiverse Workforces: RoSPA RoSPA has highlighted the importance of adapting health and safety systems to accommodate neurodiverse employees, noting that inclusive measures benefit the entire workforce. Their “All inclusive: Neurodiversity and safety” piece explains how understanding and reasonable adjustments can improve protection and engagement for people with conditions such as ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, or dyslexia, while enhancing overall safety outcomes Understanding Neurodiversity Neurodiversity refers to variations in cognitive processing, including conditions like ADHD, ASD, dyslexia, and others. These differences can involve sensory sensitivities, communication preferences, or distinctive problem-solving styles. While such traits may present challenges under standard safety systems, they also bring strengths—heightened attention to detail or systematic thinking—that organisations can leverage when systems are designed inclusively. Why Inclusive Safety Matters Adapting safety measures for neurodiverse staff is not solely a legal or ethical obligation under equalities legislation; it fosters clearer, more effective procedures for everyone. For example, simplifying language in risk assessments or providing information in multiple formats (visual aids, concise summaries, verbal briefings) ensures critical instructions are accessible to all employees. Engaging neurodiverse individuals in safety discussions can reveal unseen hazards and opportunities for improvement. Practical Steps for Safety Managers Safety managers should begin by consulting neurodiverse employees about their needs. This may involve trial fittings of personal protective equipment to address sensory concerns or providing alternative options. Safety documentation and signage should use clear, unambiguous wording, supplemented by diagrams or icons where helpful. Training sessions can incorporate mixed media—videos, infographics, written summaries—and allow flexible pacing or repeat sessions. Workspaces might include quiet areas or adjustable layouts to reduce distractions for focused tasks. Involving neurodiverse colleagues in audits or safety committees can harness their strengths in pattern recognition or procedure adherence. Benefits Beyond Neurodiversity Measures designed for neurodiverse inclusion often enhance safety for the whole workforce. Clearer communication reduces misunderstandings; diversified training formats cater to varied learning styles; quieter spaces can support concentration for all. Additionally, inclusive practices signal an open culture where employees feel valued and more likely to report concerns. Organisations that embed neurodiversity considerations can see improved engagement, reduced incidents, and a stronger safety culture.",

    "https://www.hse-network.com/safety-first-essential-considerations-for-commercial-overhead-doors/": "07th Oct, 2024 Read time 6 minutes Safety First: Essential Considerations for Commercial Overhead Doors Commercial overhead doors are a critical component of many industrial and retail environments, and they play a vital role in everything from security and energy efficiency to operational flow. However, their size, weight, and constant use also make them potential safety hazards if not properly managed. We’ll dive into the essential safety considerations businesses need to think about when it comes to commercial overhead doors, from key safety features and industry standards to best practices for preventing accidents and injuries . By understanding and implementing these critical safety measures, businesses can protect their employees, customers, and assets while ensuring smooth operations on a day-to-day basis. Be Risk Aware Commercial overhead doors, while essential for many businesses, come with inherent risks that have to be understood and mitigated. Crushing and pinching points are perhaps the most obvious hazards, particularly at the bottom of the door and along its tracks, which can cause severe injuries if body parts are caught as the door closes. Similarly, falls and impacts are a significant risk, especially when doors are improperly secured or suddenly activated. Importantly, another issue is electrical hazards – due to the powered nature of many commercial doors, with the potential for shocks or electrocution if wiring is faulty or improperly maintained. Schedule Regular Inspections and Maintenance A robust inspection and maintenance process is vital for the ongoing safety and reliability of these doors. In addition to daily visual checks by trained staff to quickly identify common issues like damaged components or obstructions, it’s also worthwhile booking in monthly operational tests to ensure all safety features, such as auto-reverse mechanisms and photo eyes, are functioning correctly. On a quarterly basis, book in professional inspections by certified technicians who can catch more subtle issues and address wear and tear before it becomes a safety hazard. Lastly, annual comprehensive evaluations should include a thorough examination of all the mechanical, electrical, and structural components. Maintaining detailed maintenance schedules and records is crucial for tracking the door’s condition and also for demonstrating due diligence in case of accidents or regulatory inspections. Adhere to Industry Standards and Regulations There are many safety regulations businesses need to adhere to, but especially in industrial and manufacturing settings where machinery and materials can pose a bigger risk. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets out the requirements for workplace safety, and these include specific guidelines for powered industrial doors. These guidelines cover aspects like installation, maintenance, and operational safety measures. But it’s also important to note that local building codes might include specific requirements for commercial doors, particularly in terms of fire safety and emergency outlets . Companies need to ensure they’re complying with these various standards and regulations, not just as a legal obligation but as a fundamental aspect of ensuring a safe working environment. Follow Best Practices for Accident Prevention Prevention is the best course of action when it comes to safety, especially for minimising the risks associated with commercial overhead doors. First, businesses need to ensure they’re choosing the right type of door and that the specifications are appropriate for the specific application and environment. It’s also vital that the door is installed by a qualified professional to ensure the door functions safely from day one. Clear signage and warning systems should be prominently displayed around the door area, alerting staff and visitors to the potential hazards and operational procedures. Establishing clearly marked safety zones around the door also helps prevent accidents by keeping people at a safe distance when the door is in motion, and creating a culture of awareness . Invest in Employee Training and Education Your workplace is only as safe as the people working in it, which is to say that while you may have invested in safer components, if your employees aren’t trained sufficiently, accidents will still happen. Comprehensive employee training and education form the backbone of any effective safety programme, and knowing how to use overhead doors properly is included. Staff need to understand how to safely open, close, and monitor the doors, as well as spot any potential hazards so they can report issues before they lead to accidents. Emergency procedures should be clearly outlined and regularly practised too, including what to do in the event of the door malfunctioning, power outages, or if someone becomes trapped. Establishing a clear system for reporting and documenting issues also encourages employees to take an active role in workplace safety. Leaders should schedule in refresher courses throughout the year, especially in the event of updates to new safety features or a change of procedures to help keep safety at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Upgrade Older Door Systems As technology advances and safety standards evolve, upgrading older commercial overhead door systems becomes an important consideration for many businesses. Retrofitting safety features, such as photo eyes, safety edges, and automatic reversing mechanisms, can significantly improve the safety of older doors without the need for complete replacement. However, it’s essential that business owners and health and safety professionals assess whether upgrading is sufficient or if a full replacement is necessary. There are a few factors to consider here: the door’s age and overall condition how often it’s used the cost of upgrading versus replacing it fully While the initial investment in safety improvements may seem substantial, it’s important to weigh this against the potential costs of accidents , liability, and business disruption – often, these costs far outweigh the initial one-off investment. Proactive Prevention The safety of commercial doors is a multifaceted issue that requires ongoing attention and commitment. From understanding key safety features and adhering to industry standards to implementing best practices and providing thorough employee training, each aspect plays a crucial role in preventing accidents and injuries. Ultimately, prioritising safety in the management of commercial overhead doors prevents accidents as well as helping to enhance operational efficiency, reduce liability, and demonstrate a company’s commitment to the wellbeing of its stakeholders.",

    "https://www.hse-network.com/tips-for-creating-a-construction-hse-plan/": "11th Sep, 2023 Read time 7 minutes Tips for Creating a Construction HSE Plan A robust Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) plan is crucial for any firm looking to operate legally and effectively in the UK. There is no industry where this is arguably more imperative than in the evolving and somewhat unpredictable construction industry. With construction being an industry in which workers are constantly facing a plethora of risks, ensuring worker safety – as well as environmental protection – should be a top priority. The latest report from the Health and Safety Executive shows the number of fatal injuries in construction totalled 45, higher than in any other industry. Most construction managers will be well aware of the need to establish strict construction HSE policies, however, start-up founders and entrepreneurs may need to be steered in the right direction. In this article, we’ll outline key elements to include in your construction HSE plan, along with tips for implementation, to help you create a watertight strategy aligned with UK regulations. Conduct thorough risk assessments The foundation of an HSE plan is comprehensive security risk assessments and safety inspections. Every construction site and project will have unique hazards that need to be identified and controlled. Some larger and more remote sites will naturally have a different set of construction health risks than those located in urban settings with lots of foot traffic. Conduct an initial site walkthrough to spot potential dangers, such as risks associated with working at heights, noise, dust, falling objects, and hazardous substances. For each risk, determine its likelihood, potential consequences, and who could be harmed. From then, you can start to pinpoint how these risks can be eliminated and accidents prevented, or, should injuries occur, how quickly and proactively help can be arranged. Some important areas to assess include: Excavation work Scaffolding Demolition Lifting equipment Power tools Electrical systems Use of controlled substances or irritants Traffic management and site access control Workplace transport like forklifts Make sure risk assessments are done systematically by trained individuals. Situations can develop rapidly on construction sites, so review the assessments regularly and update them as needed. Establish effective incident response Even with stringent controls, accidents can – and often do – happen in construction. Your HSE plan needs to outline emergency response procedures for different incident scenarios, from administering basic first aid to securing sites and practising optimum situational awareness. Some suggestions include: Have evacuation routes mapped out and communicated to workers. Conduct practice drills regularly and ensure alarms are in good working order. Train first aiders to provide immediate medical assistance if needed. Have first aid stations clearly marked and have individuals retake training regularly. Keep spill kits on-site for containment of any chemical leaks or spillages that could irritate the skin . Have a communication protocol for notifying management, emergency services, and regulatory authorities in the event of a serious incident. Prepare investigation procedures to assess incidents objectively, including their root causes and how to prevent them from reoccurring. Implement strong security measures Construction sites, despite being as temporary and non-obstructive as possible, often contain valuable equipment and materials that can attract thieves and vandals. More often than not, thefts and trespassing incidents are opportunistic, but it pays off to ensure your HSE plan accounts for the site’s physical security and containment. This should incorporate security measures like: Performing pre-employment background checks before hiring Installing integrated, high-quality security lighting, CCTV cameras, and alarm systems Fencing off the perimeter with padlocked gates and robust interlocking concrete barriers to deter trespassers Designating SIA-licenced personnel to monitor the site after hours Requiring visitor passes, identification, and sign-in logs Safely storing and locking up tools, equipment, and materials when not in use Adequate security keeps unauthorised individuals away, reducing the risk of site accidents or theft. Outline environmental protection steps Construction work can impact the environment in several ways, from waste generation and dust and noise pollution to habitat damage and chemical spills. Your HSE plan should define how you’ll minimise environmental harm as much as possible, as corporate social responsibility and sustainability are two goals to be completely transparent about, especially considering the construction industry’s environmental impact . Useful measures include: Using silencers or mufflers on machinery to reduce noise where possible Spraying water to suppress dust around the site Establishing proper waste sorting and disposal procedures Containing and cleaning up any spills to avoid contamination Identifying ecologically sensitive areas to avoid Following environmental regulations and using best practices to reduce your project’s carbon footprint will go a long way in creating a robust and reliable HSE plan. Provide extensive training HSE awareness should be integrated right from project induction, but employees and external contractors should willingly demonstrate alignment and commitment to ensuring optimum safety. Therefore, if it’s within your remit, provide as much training as possible and cast your judgement over whether anybody needs a refresher session. Provide training on: Site hazards and control measures Proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Safe work practices for high-risk activities like confined space entry or scaffold use Emergency and evacuation protocols Hazardous materials handling Incident reporting procedures Refresher training is highly recommended from time to time, even for the most experienced contractors. Set daily tasks to review hazards and precautions for specific projects and sub-tasks, making it clear that any potential risks or hazards could develop. Well-trained personnel help sustain a safe work culture and ensure a project runs smoothly and to a deadline. Perform inspections and audits While gifting all contractors autonomy is recommended, appointed HSE managers should check that their stipulated HSE processes are being followed consistently. It’s always possible that corners may be cut (metaphorically speaking). This is why it’s important to conduct daily site and PPE inspections, alongside regular safety assessments with contractors who are spotted having deviated from your recommendations, even if unconsciously. You may find that conducting an investigation with an external auditor may be worthwhile if an incident occurs. Use inspection findings to improve policies and provide additional staff training where needed. Stay up to date on legal requirements Construction regulations get reviewed and updated regularly. Your HSE plans must evolve to ensure that you are not at risk of non-compliance and that they align with the most up-to-date UK legislation. This includes but is not limited to: The Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) Work at Height Regulations Manual Handling Operations Regulations Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (COSHH) Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (PUWER) Construction (Design and Management) Regulations Reporting Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) Review your HSE plan frequently to check if it meets UK building legislation criteria, and seek legal advice if you are unsure about compliance. Get approval from all parties Meet with clients, contractors, subcontractors and employees to communicate your HSE programme openly. Encourage all parties to give their feedback to refine the plan and ensure it accounts for all potential risk areas. Ensure that all parties are clearly aware of who the appointed contact is and who is personally responsible for health and safety responsibilities. Having agreement and cooperative participation from all parties ensures the HSE plan is most effectively implemented across the project lifecycle. Prioritising worker health, safety and environmental protection should be at the heart of construction operations. Following all these tips will help you develop a comprehensive HSE plan tailored to your projects, manage risks effectively, and ultimately create an incident-free workplace.",
    "https://www.hse-network.com/its-time-to-tackle-skin-problems-in-the-construction-industry/": "27th Jul, 2023 Read time 5 minutes It’s Time to Tackle Skin Problems in the Construction Industry If you work in construction, constant use of hands and being on your feet all day can neglect your skin. Exposure to harmful chemicals, harsh outdoor conditions, and heavy-duty PPE can lead to serious skin conditions . Occupational skin diseases are common among construction workers and can seriously affect finances due to the impact of taking time off and the self-employed nature. Margaret Dabbs OBE , an expert in foot and hand health, shares tips for maintaining hands and feet in top condition. Follow her hacks to safeguard your well-being and career. Why should you look after your skin and hands? Our skin, the largest organ, reflects overall health and is our primary defence against bacteria and germs. Despite the stereotype, the men’s personal care market was valued at £24.4 billion in 2021 , and is projected to grow 8.7% by 2030 , showing a genuine demand for reliable skincare from modern men, who dominate the UK construction sector (85%). Women are significantly underrepresented , comprising only 15% of construction workers, with a mere 2% working with tools. Ill-fitting PPE poses challenges, leading some to expose their skin to irritants or wear oversized shoes, risking injuries. Dry or irritated hands/feet with cuts invite bacterial infections, hindering work efficiency and causing illness. Ignoring such issues can lead to staph infection from the bacteria always present on the surface of your skin or tetanus if cuts and cracks on your hands are left untreated, as the bacteria like to live in these areas . Proper skincare is crucial for both men and women in construction to ensure health and productivity. Common construction conditions Construction work has inherent risks, including injuries from dangerous situations and heavy-duty machinery. Prolonged use of vibrating tools like chainsaws or pneumatic drills can lead to hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), where nerves sustain minor injuries, causing gradual loss of function. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and Vibration white finger (VWF), the most common disease prescribed under the Industrial Injuries Disability Benefit scheme, resulting from excessive tool use. These conditions can lead to health issues and work loss, significantly impacting finances, especially for self-employed individuals. Preventive measures include: Using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Opting for low-vibration tools. Using additional PPE like anti-vibration gloves or wrist braces. Taking regular 10-minute breaks and keeping hands warm during work is also beneficial. Contact dermatitis Contact dermatitis, accounting for 80% of work-related skin conditions , causes an uncomfortable and itchy rash. Working with materials like cement sans proper protective equipment can trigger it , even without prior skin issues. Once an unknown allergy is activated, your skin may remain susceptible to that material for life, as desensitisation is impossible. To safeguard against contact dermatitis, ensure your employer provides well-fitting PPE. Prevention is key; wearing gloves or long sleeves post-exposure won’t cure the condition. Instead, adopt a regular moisturising routine, avoid allergens, and consult your doctor for medicated creams. Protecting your skin is vital for a healthier work experience. Dry, cracked skin Dryness and irritation are common skin issues, with 62% of UK buyers purchasing products claiming to treat dry skin. Working outdoors or with hazardous materials can exacerbate conditions like eczema, subjecting hands and feet to daily stress and irritants. Frequent hand washing or sanitising removes the skin’s natural protective oils , leading to sore, parched skin and a weakened skin barrier. To protect your skin, Margaret Dabbs recommends regular use of moisturiser, applying hand and foot lotion in your daily routine and after washing hands. Using sanitisers with added moisturisers is beneficial, but a dedicated lightweight, non-greasy lotion is ideal for post-sanitisation. For intensive treatment, apply a thick layer of cream before bedtime, wearing gloves or socks to enhance absorption. Prioritise moisturising to prevent dry, cracked skin and potential injuries. Skin under pressure Wearing thick, hard shoes like steel-toe caps common in construction can create excessive pressure on feet, especially if the shoes don’t fit well. This pressure can lead to hyperkeratosis , where the skin produces thick layers in response to irritants or pressure, causing pain and walking difficulties. Calluses and corns can also form due to thickened skin, which is particularly painful for construction workers who spend long hours on their feet or working with heavy tools. To heal your skin, moisturise and exfoliate feet with hydrating lotions and gentle foot scrubs to prevent hyperkeratosis. Use a foot file to remove dead skin and nourish the newly-revealed skin with hydrating foot oil. For corns and calluses, alleviate pressure by placing wool, soft cotton, or moleskin between toes. Taking care of your feet is crucial for a comfortable and productive work experience. Serious skin damage Neglecting skin conditions can have severe consequences, impacting motor skills, work, and overall health. Around 16,000 individuals in the UK believe their skin conditions worsen due to work-related factors. Alarming data reveals over 100,000 new cases of skin cancer annually in the UK, with 44% diagnosed in construction workers and 42% of occupational skin cancer deaths within this industry. Incorporating sunscreen into your daily routine is essential, especially if you work primarily outdoors, on sites or around scaffolding. Incorporating sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and broad-spectrum UVB and UVA ray protection is crucial, especially for outdoor workers. Sunscreen should be used daily, even on cloudy days, as sun damage accumulates over time. Following these skin-saving tips and seeking medical advice for worsening conditions or serious illnesses like skin cancer is essential for maintaining healthy and hydrated skin. So try some of these skin-saving tips today and notice how hydrated and fresh your skin feels. Remember to always consult your doctor or dermatologist if your skin condition worsens. If you have a more severe illness, such as skin cancer, contact your doctor before using any non-prescribed treatments or creams on your skin.",
    "https://www.hse-network.com/five-key-stories-about-health-and-safety/": "20th May, 2023 Read time 4 minutes Five key stories about Health and Safety The world of health and safety is ever evolving, and it’s easy to lose track of current trends or key stories to keep in mind. To help you with understanding that ever changing landscape, here is our brief roundup of some of those important news items. Reducing Vehicle deaths on farms Agriculture is the most dangerous sector in Britain, with an average fatal incident rate 21 times higher than the industrial average. The majority of those incidents are caused by vehicles. Because of this, the HSE has launched a new campaign calling on everyone in the farming community to do what they can to reduce the number of injuries involving vehicles and save lives. HSE says there are three key areas to keep in mind with vehicle safety: operating a safe farm, maintaining a safe vehicle and being a safe driver. Nitrous Oxide levels in some hospitals have far exceeded legal limits The BBC has found that Nitrous oxide levels on Watford General Hospital’s maternity suite far exceeded legal limits during peak periods. In February 2022, air monitoring showed levels of almost 5,000ppm – 50 times what is safe. After the results of this monitoring, many NHS trusts have suspended the use of Entonox – a mixture of nitrous oxide and air used to assist women in labour with pain relief. Staff working in such units face uncertainty due to prolonged periods of time spent in affected areas, with particular concerns over Vitamin B deficiency due to exposure. Daylight saving time and its effect on health and safety As the clocks have jumped forward, a discussion about daylight saving time and its affects on health and safety has reemerged. Shifting clocks interferes with our sun, body and social clocks. The sun clock is the passage of time marked by midday being when the sun is at its highest point. Our body clock is set to the rhythms of our sleep and exposure to sunlight and darkness. The social clock is the time on your watch. Every time there is a change in the social clock, e.g. daylight saving time, it changes our alignment with the sun clock. This leads to a rise in accidents; with car crashes increasing as tired workers drive home in the dark. Aside from those more obvious accidents, there are other negative effects such as productivity. Losing an hour’s sleep at the end of March leads to a wave of tired workers whose body clock is displaced, which in turn leads to workplace errors and accidents that equate to millions of pounds in lost productivity and health and safety problems. Health and Safety concerns around TikTok, amid talk of a ban in the UK and the US As the UK Parliament has banned Chinese-owned social media app TikTok from its network over security concerns, and there have been considerations on banning TikTok in the UK and the US; the TikTok CEO was questioned about health and safety concerns at a congressional hearing. A large focus was placed on the platform’s algorithm impact on mental health, particularly of its young users. The Republican congressman Gus Bilirakis placed large emphasis on story of Chase Nasca, a 16-year-old boy who committed suicide after being “targeted” with unsolicited self-harm content. A majority of teenagers use TikTok – with 67% of people ages 13 to 17 saying they have used the app; which has raised a number of concerns about its impact, with self-harm and eating disorder-related content spreading on the platform. UK Companies worry about health and safety ahead of the Retained EU Law Bill A survey of UK businesses has found that British companies strongly support health and safety regulations and highlighted fears over the impact of the Retained EU Law Bill. 69% of businesses are not willing to accept lower health and safety standards as part of the Retained EU Law Bill. Less than 20% of businesses cited excessive government regulation as their largest issue; with the cost of energy (70%), inflation (65%) and a shortage of labour (45%) being their primary concerns.",
    "https://press.hse.gov.uk/2025/07/02/latest-annual-work-related-fatalities-published/": "124 workers died in work-related incidents in 2024/25 2,218 mesothelioma deaths in 2023 through past exposure to asbestos Latest annual figures show 124 workers were killed in work-related incidents in Great Britain. A decrease of fourteen from the previous 12-month period. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has today, Wednesday 2 July, published its latest annual fatality statistics , covering the period from April 2024 to March 2025. The number of deaths remain broadly in line with pre-pandemic levels, and compares to 223 twenty years ago (2004/05) and 495 in 1981. The industries with the highest number of deaths were construction (35) and agriculture, forestry and fishing (23). Of all main industry sectors, agriculture, forestry and fishing continues to have the highest rate of fatal injury per 100,000 workers followed by waste and recycling. The most common cause of fatal injuries continues to be falls from a height (35), representing over a quarter of worker deaths in 2024/25. A further 92 people who were not at work were killed in work-related incidents in 2024/25. This refers to members of the public who were in a workplace but were not working themselves. HSE’s Chief Executive Sarah Albon said: “Great Britain is one of the safest places in the world to work, but we must remember each of these deaths represents a tragedy for families, friends and communities. “Despite the stability in numbers, we cannot accept that fatal accidents are an inevitable part of working life. We are encouraged by the long-term trend but urge against complacency on workplace safety. “Our practical and proportionate guidance is available for free on our website, and further support is available if needed.” The figures relate to work-related accidents and do not include deaths arising from occupational diseases or diseases arising from certain occupational exposures. The HSE has also published the annual figures for mesothelioma , a cancer caused by past exposure to asbestos. The figures show that 2,218 people died from the disease in 2023, representing a fall of 62 compared with 2022 and substantially lower than the average of 2,508 deaths per year over the ten-year period 2011-2020. Current mesothelioma deaths reflect exposure to asbestos that often occurred before the 1980s and annual deaths are expected to continue declining during the next decade. Notes to editors The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is Britain’s national regulator for workplace health and safety. We are dedicated to protecting people and places, and helping everyone lead safer and healthier lives. Prior to 1981 only fatal injury numbers to employees were reported to enforcing authorities. A further 92 people who were not at work were killed in work-related incidents in 2024/25 (excluding work-related deaths to ‘patients and service users’ in England in health and social care premises registered with CQC).",
    "https://press.hse.gov.uk/2025/05/14/farm-fined-after-workers-leg-trapped-in-machine/": "“Safe stop” procedure must be followed when using potato harvesters, says regulator A farming partnership has been fined £20,000 after an employee trapped his leg in a potato harvester machine whilst working on a farm in Cheshire. The employee, who was 20-years-old at the time, was working for LP Ollier & Son on its potato farm when the incident occurred on 18 October 2023. Whilst assessing a blockage in the potato harvester machine, the roller mechanism caught his right leg and pulled it into the device, causing serious injuries including crushing, fractures, nerve damage and skin damage. He has been unable to work in agriculture since the incident. Employee leg after it became trapped in potato harvester An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found the guard gates to the machine were open and the machine was not isolated. LP Ollier & Son failed to prevent access to dangerous parts of machinery, namely the rotating parts of a potato harvester by means of implementing and following a suitable safe system of work. HSE guidance states that employers must follow the ‘safe stop’ procedure when using a potato harvester, including when dealing with blockages. This is in order to ensure that dangerous parts are not accessed when the machine is powered. Suitable training must be given, and monitoring and supervision must be in place to ensure that the ‘safe stop’ procedure is adhered to at all times. Guidance can be found here: Safe use of potato harvesters – HSE. Potato harvester machine LP Ollier & Son, of Frog Lane Farm, Frog Lane, Knutsford, Cheshire, pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2(1) of Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. The partnership was fined £20,000 with a £2000 victim surcharge and ordered to pay £5,110.80 in costs at Warrington Magistrates Court. HSE inspector Joseph Wright said: “All too often, serious and sometimes fatal incidents occur as a result of inadequate systems of work in relation to potato harvesters. This case was a wholly avoidable incident caused by the failure to follow the safe stop procedure for the potato harvester, and ensure that the machine was fully isolated before a blockage was addressed. Had the partnership ensured a suitable safe system of work was followed when blockages occurred, these life-changing injuries would not have occurred. “The fine imposed on LP Ollier & Son should underline to everyone in the potato harvesting trade and wider agricultural industry, that the courts, and HSE, take a failure to abide by the law very seriously. We will not hesitate to take action when there is a failure to keep employees and contractors safe while they are working.” This HSE prosecution was brought by HSE enforcement lawyer Julian White and paralegal officer Imogen Isaac.

    "https://press.hse.gov.uk/2025/05/01/company-fined-after-worker-suffers-serious-injuries/": "A haulage distribution company has been fined after a worker suffered serious injuries to his shoulder when a wrought iron gate fell on him. Kevin Simcox, 60-years-old, was working for Stan Robinson Distribution Ltd in Stafford when the incident occurred on 28 February 2020. He arrived at the site for his morning shift and was opening the main entrance gate, which weighs between 250 and 350kgs, when the gate fell off its hinges and knocked him to the ground. He was hit on the head but had a motorbike helmet on at the time, the helmet was crushed and Mr Simcox suffered a fractured vertebrae in his neck and back. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found that the top hinge of the gate was loose which resulted in the gate coming free from its locating pin. The company failed to ensure that its employees had a safe means of access and egress to their place of work. Employees had previously raised several concerns with managers regarding difficulties in opening and closing the gate, dating back several years. Stan Robinson Distribution Ltd failed to appropriately address the concerns raised and the incident occurred because of a failure of the gate’s hinge mechanism. There was an inadequate system in place for identifying, actioning, recording and monitoring health and safety issues. Employees were seemingly unaware of any system to formally record issues, with health and safety issues being reported only verbally. Stan Robinson Distribution Ltd, of Burlington Drive, Stafford, pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Regulations 1974 and have been fined £6,000 and ordered to pay costs of £5,366.60. After the hearing, HSE inspector Marie Wheeler said: “This case highlights the importance of regular pro-active maintenance and inspection of work equipment, including entrance gates, to ensure equipment does not deteriorate to the extent that it puts people at risk. In this case Stan Robinson (Distribution) Ltd failed to effectively maintain their equipment and it could have easily resulted in a fatal injury. “This incident could so easily have been avoided by simply carrying out correct control measures and safe working practices. “Companies should be aware that HSE will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against those that fall below the required standards.” This HSE prosecution was brought by HSE enforcement lawyer Chloe Ward and paralegal officer Helen Hugo.

The 61-year-old was working for Camclad Contractors Limited, replacing cladding panels on a former abattoir that had been damaged in a storm, when the incident took place at Gaerwen Industrial Estate, Anglesey, on 24 January 2018. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found that the work had only been planned from photographs and that no site visit had taken place before starting the work. The dimensions of the building were not known to the contractor. This meant the cherry picker hired to allow safe access to height did not reach all parts of the structure that were to be repaired. To complete the work, workers had to leave the safety of the cherry picker basket and used boards found on site to work on the fragile roof. It was whilst doing this that slipped and fell through the fragile roof, landing on the concrete floor below. Employers and those in control of any work at height activity must make sure work is properly planned, supervised and carried out by competent people. HSE has guidance on working at height which includes using the right type of equipment for working at height. Speaking after the case HSE principal inspector Damian Corbett said: “Those in control of work have a responsibility to devise safe methods of working and to provide the necessary information and instruction to their workers in the safe system of working. “If the work had been adequately planned, it would have provided a suitable safe system of work and prevented the risk of falls through fragile materials. Companies should be aware that HSE will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against those who fall below the required standards.” Camclad Contractors Limited of Wyboston Lakes, Great North Road, Wyboston, Bedfordshire pleaded guilty to breaching Regulation 4(1) of the Work at Height Regulations 2005 and been fined £225,000 and ordered to pay costs of £10,000. A director of the company, Dominic Lakeman-Pettit also of Great North Road, Wyboston, Bedfordshire pleaded guilty to breaching section 37(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and was sentenced to four months in prison suspended for 12 months and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work.

    "https://press.hse.gov.uk/2025/04/28/window-manufacturing-company-fined-after-worker-seriously-injures-hand/": "A window manufacturer has been fined £100,000 after a teenage worker had two fingers severed by a cross-cutting saw. The 19-year-old was working for Ford Windows Limited at the company’s site in Sheffield when the incident occurred. He had loaded a cross-cut saw with a length of windowsill, which had been stored outside in the rain. As he went to cut the windowsill, his hand slipped off the wet workpiece into the unguarded part of the blade, resulting in severing parts of two fingers on his left hand. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation found that the company had not conducted a suitable and sufficient risk assessment of the cross-cut saw, failed to identify the need to adjust the nose guard of the saw to minimise the amount of blade exposed, and failed to identify the need to dry the materials before cutting. The investigation also found that the company also failed to provide suitable information, instruction, and training to employees on working safely for this activity. Guidance on the machinery safety, including maintaining machinery can be found on the HSE website: Introduction to machinery safety – HSE Ford Windows Limited of Catley Road, Darnall, Sheffield pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and received a fine of £100,000 and ordered to pay costs of £4227.50. After the hearing the HM principal inspector Chris Tilley commented: “The company failed in several areas, they had no competent person responsible for health and safety at the site, they failed to conduct a suitable and sufficient risk assessment and therefore did not have a suitable safe system of work for the safe use of the saw, which left the nose guard of the saw incorrectly positioned. “The company’s failure to risk assess meant that they could not communicate information, instruction, and training to their employees on how to use the saw safely. “If the company had taken the time to risk assess the required controls, to safely use the cross-cut saw, they would have found that suitable measures could have been implemented for zero cost, as the guard was available on the machine and simply needed manually adjusting to guard the blade.” The prosecution was bought by enforcement lawyer Arfaq Nabi assisted by paralegal officer Imogen Isaac.

    "https://press.hse.gov.uk/2025/04/16/council-fined-for-multiple-failures-on-guided-busway/": "• Major transport system operated for almost a decade without basic safety measures • Council “chose to appeal enforcement action instead of acting on concerns”, says regulator • Families pay tribute to loved ones Cambridgeshire County Council has been fined £6 million after pleading guilty to serious safety failings on its Guided Busway that led to three deaths and multiple injuries over a ten-year period. The prosecution follows a long and complex Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation, where incidents continued to happen despite regular enforcement action from the regulator. A guided busway is purpose-built track exclusively for buses to bypass traffic congestion. Three people died after being hit by buses on the network. Jennifer Taylor, 81, died in darkness at an unlit crossing in November 2015. Three years later beloved family man Steve Moir, 50, was killed after his bike struck a kerb, causing him to fall into the path of an oncoming bus. Kathleen Pitts, 52, lost her life in October 2021. Two young people also suffered serious injuries in separate incidents. Despite the first fatality in 2015, the council didn’t conduct its first risk assessment until August 2016; which was five years after the Guided Busway first opened. The HSE investigation also found that basic safety measures were missing across the busway including lighting of some crossing points, appropriate speed limits for buses, sufficient measures to separate pedestrians and other users including cyclists from passing buses, and adequate signage warning of dangers. In a statement, Mrs Taylor’s family: “Jenny was deeply loved by all of us, and we dearly miss her. “As a family we would like to thank the HSE for their tireless efforts in bringing this case to court. We hope that the lessons learned will lead to sustained safety improvements and help avoid tragedy, injury and suffering in the future.” Mr Moir, an active cyclist who coached local youth football and served as a school governor, was thrown into the path of a bus travelling at 56mph after losing control on the narrow maintenance path running alongside the busway. “The loss of Steve has left us devastated and there is now a big hole in our lives that cannot be filled,” Mr Moir’s family said in a statement following the hearing at Cambridge Crown Court. “Steve was a loving, caring family man with a great sense of humour and a zest for life who brought laughter and joy to our lives every day and his presence is deeply missed by us all.” Following his death, the council reduced the speed limit to 30mph in the area in question, but this failed to prevent the subsequent fatal incident involving Kathleen Pitts in October 2021. Just three weeks after Ms Pitts’ death, a 16-year-old cyclist suffered life-changing injuries at a designated crossing point. After the hearing, HSE principal inspector Graham Tompkins said: “This is a truly tragic case where three people lost their lives and others suffered serious injuries in incidents that were completely preventable. “Had Cambridgeshire County Council properly assessed and managed the risks on the Guided Busway from the outset, these deaths simply would not have happened. Even after the first fatality in 2015, the council failed to take adequate action to protect the public. They chose to appeal our enforcement action instead of acting on our concerns and incidents continued to happen. “Simple measures could have saved lives and life changing injuries. Instead, the council operated this major transport system for almost a decade without many of the basic safety measures we see in every village, town and city being in place. “The families of those who died have shown remarkable courage throughout this process, and I hope this prosecution brings some measure of closure for them, though nothing can make up for the loss of their loved ones.” • Employers are required by law to protect both their employees and others from harm and assessing the risk is just one part of the overall process and HSE guidance is available to explain what steps should be taken. Specific guidance for the designers and operators of guided busways is available from Britpave (the British In-Situ Concrete Paving Association) in the Guided Busway Design Handbook (https://www.britpave.org.uk/Publications/Bus-and-Rail/). Graham Tompkins continued: “Our risk assessment guidance may be more commonly used for workplaces such as factories and construction sites, but the same principles apply for busy spaces such as major transport infrastructure. The possible risks to people and the movement of passengers, pedestrians and others needs to be thought through.” Cambridgeshire County Council of New Shire Hall, Emery Crescent, Enterprise Campus, Alconbury Weald, Huntingdon pleaded guilty to two offences under section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. The charges related to failing to protect the public both at crossing points and while travelling alongside the busway. At Cambridge Crown Court on 16 April 2025 the council was ordered to pay a fine of £6 million plus £292,460.90 in costs. Summary of key incidents • After dark on 17 November 2015, Jennifer Taylor and her husband stepped off a bus at Fen Drayton Lakes and attempted to cross the track to get on another bus towards Cambridge. They did so at the designated crossing. As they crossed the Busway, a guided bus was on the approach. There was no lighting in this area so Mrs Taylor was not visible to the bus driver, who was travelling within the speed limit which was at the time 56mph. By the time Mrs Taylor was in sight of the bus driver, it was too late. She died at the scene. • On 13 September 2018, Steve Moir, an experienced cyclist, was cycling along the access road that facilitates maintenance of the guided busway. The space was opened up to the public as a pedestrian pathway and cycle route by Cambridge County Council. Mr Moir was near Clare College’s sports ground when he lost control of his bicycle in busy cyclist and pedestrian traffic. His front wheel struck the raised kerb that separates the guided track and access road. He was flown over his handlebars into the path of an oncoming bus. The bus was travelling within the speed limit set by Cambridgeshire County Council, which was at this time, 56mph. The bus was unable to stop in time to avoid Mr Moir. Mr Moir died at the scene. • On 1 May 2019, a then 12-year-old cyclist, was attempting to cross the Busway between Ring Fort Road and King’s Hedges Road when she was struck by a bus and sustained injuries requiring hospital treatment. • On 26 October 2021, Kathleen Pitts was walking along the pathway a few hundred meters south Mr Moir’s accident near Clare College’s sports ground. She was next to the southern guided section of the Busway when she was struck by a passing bus and killed. The oncoming northbound bus which hit her had been travelling at the 30mph speed limit which was the revised limit for the that section set by Cambridge County Council after Mr Moir’s death. • After dark on 9 November 2021 a then 16-year-old cyclist, was struck and the designated Buchan Street crossing. This left the cyclist with life changing injuries. Investigation findings The HSE investigation identified safety management failings within Cambridgeshire County Council for the operation of the Busway for a period of just over 10 years. These failures related to two distinct risks; members of the public seeking to cross the Busway at designated crossing points and risks to members of the public when they were merely in its vicinity, or seeking to travel alongside it. Despite interventions by HSE which included two Improvement Notices, Cambridgeshire County Council failed to adequately manage safety on the Busway until late 2021. The Busway opened in 2011, but it was not until August 2016 after one death and several serious injuries on the Busway, that the first risk assessment was undertaken. This risk assessment did not adequately assess the risk to members of the public crossing, or being alongside, the Busway. For example, in locations where the Busway was more crowded and where the adjacent access pathway was narrow, congestion was more likely. This would lead to people being jostled or unknowingly deliberately moving into the path of a bus, as in some sections there were no separators such as grass verges, physical barriers or fences to keep them to the access pathway. Furthermore, Cambridgeshire County Council did not consider other measures to reduce the risk to members of the public, such as speed limits and the provision of lighting and suitable signage.

    "https://press.hse.gov.uk/2025/04/14/truffles-bakery-fined-after-employee-loses-part-of-finger/": "A Sussex bakery firm has been fined £12,000, for failing to prevent access to dangerous parts of machinery, after an employee lost part of his left index finger. Kevin Norman was working at the company’s production site in Henfield, West Sussex, on 20 December 2023, when he reached into the dough divider to remove a piece of dough that was stuck. The 64-year old’s finger got caught in a shear point created between the rotating drum and a transfer roller. Despite the machine having guards and interlocks, the tunnel guard over the conveyor was too short, enabling Mr Norman to reach through it to remove the dough whilst the machine was still running, resulting in him losing part of his finger. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found that Truffles Bakers and Confectioners Limited had failed to prevent access to dangerous parts of machinery. Employers are required to take effective measures, such as fixed or interlocked guarding situated at sufficient distance from the danger zone, to prevent access to dangerous parts of machinery. Guidance on the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 is available at Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (PUWER) – HSE Truffles Bakers and Confectioners Limited pleaded guilty to a breach of Regulation 11(1) of The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998. The company was fined £12,000 and was ordered to pay £3,045.65 costs at a hearing at Worthing Magistrates Court on 14th April 2025. After the hearing, HSE Inspector Stephanie Hickford-Smith said: “Employers must constantly review the guarding arrangements on machines to ensure there is no access to dangerous parts. As an employer, you cannot rely solely on the presence of a guard. You must make sure it works effectively, and persons are not able to bypass it.” This HSE prosecution was brought by HSE enforcement lawyer Samantha Tiger and supported by HSE paralegal officer Rebecca Withell.

    "https://press.hse.gov.uk/2025/04/08/engineering-firm-fined-after-worker-suffers-multiple-injuries/": "A engineering firm in Greater Manchester has been fined £100,000 after an employee’s arms, legs and feet were crushed when he became trapped under a large metal frame. Richard Jones was welding a large ‘A frame’ for Oldham Engineering Limited at its factory in Oldham when the incident occurred on 27 September 2023. The A Frame was an unusual shape and needed to be turned and rotated using a crane so that the welding could be carried out on a horizontal plane, to ensure the quality of the weld. Mr Jones had rotated the A frame and was inside the frame welding a bracket when the A Frame moved and toppled on top of him, landing on his left arm, left leg and right foot. The frame weighed approximately 1.63 tonnes. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found that Oldham Engineering Ltd failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of their employees. The task of welding large structures that had the potential to be unstable, was not risk assessed to identify the obvious risks and no safe system of work was provided to him. HSE guidance states that employers must make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the health and safety risks employees are exposed whilst they are at work. They must also provide employees with safe systems of work and provide information, instruction, training and supervision as is necessary to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety at work of employees. A link to a simple risk assessment process is available on the HSE website: Managing risks and risk assessment at work – Overview -HSE Oldham Engineering Ltd of Overens Street, Oldham pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2 (1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. The company was fined £100,000 and ordered to pay £4,519.90 in costs at Manchester Magistrates’ Court on 8 April 2025. After the hearing HSE inspector Mike Lisle said “This life changing accident could have been avoided if Oldham Engineering had properly risk assessed the welding of large potentially unstable structures and identified suitable control measures to reduce the risk of a structure falling, for example the correct use of chocs for stability. A safe system of work or method statement then should have been put in place and communicated to the welders to ensure their safety.” This HSE prosecution was brought by HSE enforcement lawyer Matthew Reynolds and paralegal officer Rebecca Withell.

    "https://press.hse.gov.uk/2025/04/02/fine-for-waste-firm-after-man-run-over-on-his-first-day-of-work/": "Worker “lucky to be alive” after being hit from behind by moving shovel loader HSE guidance says pedestrians and moving vehicles must be segregated A waste and recycling company in Oldham has been fined £250,000 after a man was run over on his first day on the job. The then 40-year-old was hand picking waste when he was hit from behind by a moving shovel loader. The digger drove over the man and had to reverse when the alarm was raised by nearby colleagues. CCTV footage of the incident, at the Mossdown Road site of Wheeldon Brothers Waste Limited, has been released. The man, now 44, suffered a bone fracture, as well as muscle and nerve damage to his leg after being struck by the vehicle in the yard on 28 July 2021. The incident happened on his first day in employment as a waste picker. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found that he had been hand picking waste after the conveyor belt they used had been removed from use after it was significantly damaged in a fire a few months earlier. Employees were therefore required to work directly on the ground, near moving vehicles with no separation between them, putting the workers in considerable danger. There was no risk assessment and a lack of supervision for picking and sorting waste on the ground. HSE guidance states that pedestrians and moving vehicles should be segregated when waste is being manually sorted. A safety bulletin was also issued a few months after this incident with specific guidance on the use of wheeled loading shovels. After the incident the man spent one week in hospital because of his injuries. He has now returned to work with a different company. The HSE investigation also found the company had failed to ensure there were adequate measures in place for the safe segregation of vehicles and pedestrians. There was no risk assessment for this altered work activity after the fire and supervision and monitoring was inadequate. Wheeldon Brothers Waste Limited, of Bury New Road, Bury, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, was fined £250,000 and ordered to pay £4102.32 costs at a hearing at Manchester Magistrates’ Court on 2 April 2025. After the hearing, HSE principal inspector Lisa Bailey said: “This man is lucky to be alive. “Vehicles such as shovel loaders require plenty of space due to the number of blind spots and poor visibility. “This incident was easily avoidable by implementing control measures and safe practises. Measures should have been implemented to ensure that workers present in the yard were not put at risk from moving vehicles in and around where they were working, including rigorous pedestrian and vehicle segregation and safe refuge for workers whilst vehicles are operating. “This should be a reminder to the waste industry of the need to ensure that workplace transport is appropriately considered, with control measures introduced to ensure the appropriate separation of vehicles and pedestrians.” The prosecution was supported by HSE enforcement lawyer Sam Crockett and paralegal officer Louisa Shaw.

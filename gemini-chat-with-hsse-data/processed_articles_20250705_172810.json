  "dashboard_summary": "Good morning, everyone. Our recent workplace safety performance is unacceptable. We've seen a spike in incidents, particularly within our construction operations, resulting in significant financial penalties. We need to take immediate action to reverse this trend.\n\nOur primary concerns revolve around the high number of high-risk incidents. The frequency of near misses and the severity of potential injuries are alarming. It appears there is a lack of adherence to safety protocols and potentially inadequate training at some of our construction sites. The fact that all incidents occurred in construction requires us to analyse working practices.\n\nI strongly recommend that each of you immediately initiate a comprehensive review of safety procedures on your respective sites. This should include a full safety audit, refresher training for all personnel, and a renewed emphasis on hazard identification and risk mitigation. We must get to the root cause of these incidents and ensure a safe working environment for all employees.",

      "content": "A construction firm has been fined £40,000 after an apprentice joiner had his thumb severed off by a rotating blade. The teenage apprentice was working for 3B Construction when the incident happened during the conversion of a 19th century hunting lodge into a luxury hotel in the Highlands. At the time of the incident on 8 June 2021, the apprentice, who had been with the company for six months, was using a portable table saw to cut plasterboard during the project at Hope Lodge in Tongue. His hand came into contact with the saw blade when he went to flick away material on it and the blade cut through his thumb. He was taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and underwent surgery where doctors managed to reattach his thumb. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said he still has long term complications as a result of the incident. \"He believes his thumb is working to around 70 per cent of what it used to be, and it has healed as much as it can,\" they said. \"It is shorter than his other thumb, he can’t bend it fully and it is permanently swollen. In winter he suffers significant discomfort when the thumb becomes stiff and sore.\" However, the man has since resumed his apprenticeship with another firm. The HSE said the 3B Construction was been fined £40,000 at Tain Sheriff Court. During its investigation the health and safety watchdog found that 3B Construction failed to: undertake a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks to employees operating a table circular saw, ensure that the system of work for the operation of said saw was safe and appropriately supervised, provided the apprentice joiners with the information, instruction and training needed to operate said saw safely. The HSE said 3B Construction Limited, of Cassillis Business Park, Minishant Ayr, pleaded guilty to Section 2(1) and Section 33(1)(a) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. HSE inspector Norman Schouten said: “While this young man continues to live with the trauma and impact of this incident, it’s greatly encouraging to see him continuing to work as a joiner. “However, it is only the efforts of medical professionals that prevented this from becoming a permanent amputation following the failures of the company. “Companies and individuals should be aware that HSE will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action against those that fall below the required standards.” 2025-07-04 Nicola Harley Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Add to Bookmarks",
